# Syringomyelia-symptoms

Syringomyelia is a rare condition in which a cavity, or syrinx, forms in the spinal cord, leading to permanent nerve damage. Symptoms can vary dramatically but often manifest as painful sensations in the arms and legs, including aches, tingles, and involuntary movement. Anecdotal evidence suggests that sudden changes in atmospheric conditions, especially barometric pressure, can exacerbate the symptoms. 
Being such a rare condition, there is very little publically available research on the subject. This project is an attempt to uncover direct correlations, in order to provide some insight for people with the condition.
